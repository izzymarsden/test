                                    Mix together water and yeast, let stand for 5 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, mix together your flour 
                                    and salt. Add your yeast mixture along with the olive oil and mix together with your hand until all liquid
                                     is absorbed and dough is shaggy. Cover and allow to rest for 30 minutes. 
                                     <br> <br> While it is resting take about 1/2 cup olive oil and chop some fresh rosemary, stir together and set aside. 
                                     After 30 minutes, lightly oil your hand and stretch and fold the dough about 8 times. Take your hand and put it 
                                     on the underside of the dough, lift and stretch the dough back into the centre. Repeat this 7 times around the bowl. 
                                     <br> <br>Cover and rest the dough for 45 minutes.
                                     <br> <br>After 45 minutes, repeat this process again,
                                     the dough should be slightly softer and stretcher - be gentle as to not knock too much air out. 
                                     After the 8 stretch and folds, cover and rest for another 45 minutes.
                                     <br> <br>Repeat the stretch and fold again after 45 minutes, then cover and rest for another 45 minutes.

                                     <br> <br>Take a large baking tray and cover the base with some of the rosemary olive oil. It
                                     shouldn't be swimming in olive oil but be generous. give your dough 2 or 3 stretch and folds 
                                     (just to get it out of the bowl) and lift if into your tray so that the smooth side is facing up. 
                                     Use your fingers to spread the dough to the edges, 
                                     it will be a little difficult initially but just keep at it. Pour more of the olive oil over the top and dimple the 
                                     dough with your fingers, pressing right down to the bottom. Rest the dough for 50 minutes, meanwhile, preheat your oven to 180°C/355F.
                                     <br> <br> When the dough has risen, sprinkle sea
                                      salt flakes over the top (i like to dimple it one
                                      more time very gently) and then sprinkle some whole rosemary leaves on top and the sliced red onion or shallot. 
                                      <br> <br>Bake for 40-50 minutes or until nice and golden brown.

                                    Combine the minced ginger and hot water in a small bowl. Stir to mix well and set aside.<br> <br> 

                                    Prepare the dough <br>
                                    In a large tall plate or a big bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, cornstarch, instant yeast and sugar. Stir to mix well. <br>
                                    Slowly pour in the warm water and mix until it a shaggy dough forms. Pour in the vegetable oil and mix until oil is absorbed. <br>
                                    Knead for 15 to 20 minutes, until the dough is quite smooth and elastic and there is no dry flour left in the bowl. Cover and seal 
                                    the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rest until it doubles in size, 1 hour or so. <br><br>

                                    Prepare the filling <br>
                                    Add the ginger water, soy sauce, oyster sauce, salt, sugar, and white pepper to the ground pork in a large bowl. 
                                    Mix until all the liquid is absorbed and the meat is sticky. Add the scallions and sesame oil. Mix until they are incorporated. 
                                    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap. Store in the fridge until ready to use. <br><br>

                                    Assemble the buns <br>
                                    When the dough has rested, transfer to a work surface and punch it down. Knead for 1 minute to deflate the air out completely, then 
                                    form it back into a ball. <br>
                                    Cut the dough in half. Wrap half of the dough in plastic wrap and store in the fridge while working on the other half. <br>
                                    Poke a hole in the center of the dough you're working with. Stretch the dough into a large oval by running your fingers along the 
                                    inside of the hole in a circular motion. Once the diameter of the dough is about 1” (2.5 cm), tear apart the ring so it creates a 
                                    long, thin strip. <br>
                                    Cut the dough strip into 12 even pieces. Gently use a circular motion to round up each dough piece then flatten it with your palm. 
                                    Cover them with plastic wrap to prevent drying out. <br>
                                    Work on one piece of dough at a time, take one dough piece and place in front of you. Roll it with a rolling pin in one hand, using 
                                    the other hand to rotate the dough while rolling, until the diameter reaches 5” (13 cm). You should keep the edges thinner than the 
                                    center, so the wrapper of the bun will be even once you make the pleats. <br>
                                    Place the rolled dough in your palm and add 1 tablespoon of filling in the center. <br>
                                    Start wrapping the bun by folding and pinching the edge over itself, in one direction, until it is almost sealed. Then rotate and 
                                    pinch the top of the pleats to fully seal the bun. <br> <br>

                                    Cook the buns <br>
                                    Add 2 tablespoons of oil and carefully place 12 wrapped buns into a 9” or 10” skillet. Cook buns uncovered for 3 minutes, until the bottoms are lightly browned. <br>
                                    Pour about 1/4 cup hot water into the pan, just enough to cover the buns halfway up. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for about 8 minutes, until the water is completely evaporated. <br>
                                    Turn the heat to medium-low and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes. Turn the heat off and remove the pan from the stove. Let the buns rest with the lid on for an additional 2 minutes. Remove the lid and transfer to a plate. <br>
                                    Serve hot and top with chili oil, sliced scallions, and sesame seeds! <br>
